# Credit Card Fraud Prediction 🚨

A machine learning project aimed at detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using multiple classification algorithms.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project addresses the challenge of detecting credit card fraud from highly imbalanced transaction data. It explores and compares several machine learning models to identify which performs best in recognizing fraudulent activity from a real-world dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Train and evaluate multiple ML models: K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree.
- Compare model performance and select the most accurate one.
- Analyze datasets and feature distributions.
- Showcase results using accuracy, precision, recall, and visualization metrics.
